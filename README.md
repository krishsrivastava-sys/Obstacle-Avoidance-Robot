### **Summary**

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an **autonomous two-wheel drive obstacle-avoidance robot** using an **Arduino Uno** as the central controller.

The robot detects obstacles using an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** mounted on a **servo motor** for angular scanning. An **L298N motor driver shield** controls the direction and movement of two **DC motors** based on sensor input.

By integrating hardware and software, the system enables the robot to move independently, detect nearby obstacles, and adjust its path dynamically. This project combines core concepts of **embedded systems, control theory, and robotics**, resulting in a functional prototype that mimics basic autonomous navigation used in modern robotic vehicles.

### **Scope**

- **In Scope:**
    - Designing a 2WD robot using Arduino Uno
    - Obstacle detection via ultrasonic sensor
    - Servo-based scanning and direction control
    - Motor driver integration and autonomous navigation
- **Out of Scope:**
    - Wireless communication (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth)
    - GPS or outdoor navigation
    - Complex mapping or AI-based decision-making
- **Assumptions:**
    - Robot operates in indoor environments with flat surfaces
    - Obstacles are solid and detectable within ultrasonic range (2â€“200 cm)
- **Constraints and Risks:**
    - Limited battery capacity
    - Sensor inaccuracy due to reflective or absorbent materials
    - Overheating of motors during extended use

### **Requirements**

- **Functional Requirements:**
    - Detect obstacles within 15 cm radius.
    - Halt and change direction automatically when obstacle detected.
    - Scan surroundings via servo-mounted sensor.
    - Resume forward motion when clear path is detected.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - **Performance:** Real-time response within 500 ms to sensor input.
    - **Security:** Circuit-level safety for overcurrent protection.
    - **Reliability:** Continuous operation for at least 20 minutes without failure.

### **Architecture / Approach**

- **High-Level Design:**
    
    The system consists of a central Arduino Uno microcontroller that reads distance data from the ultrasonic sensor. The servo motor rotates the sensor for environmental scanning. Based on measured distances, the Arduino commands the L298N driver to move, stop, or turn the motors accordingly.
    
- **Alternatives Considered:**
    - IR sensors (rejected due to low range and accuracy)
    - ESP32 microcontroller (not used due to unnecessary complexity for basic control)
- **Tradeoffs:**
    - Simplicity and cost-effectiveness prioritized over advanced path planning.
    - Limited computational power accepted for reduced design complexity.
- **Diagrams and References:**
    
    A block diagram illustrates the interaction between Arduino, sensor, servo, and motors.
